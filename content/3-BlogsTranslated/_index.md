###  [Blog 1 - What Customers Need to Know About Critical Third Parties (CTPs) in the UK](3.1-Blog1/)
The UK Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime establishes a robust framework to oversee third-party services critical to the stability and trust of the financial system. It defines Systemic Third-Party Services (STPS), sets clear expectations for testing, incident management, and regulatory reporting, and aligns with international standards for operational resilience.

While the regime does not impose direct obligations on financial institutions’ customers, it emphasizes accurate reporting and transparency to enable regulators to identify and manage risks effectively. AWS supports this outcomes-based framework and remains committed to helping customers enhance operational resilience through guidance, tools, and cloud-based services.

Overall, the CTP regime strengthens the UK financial sector by reducing systemic third-party concentration risks and promoting a more resilient, well-managed infrastructure.
