# Understanding the UK Critical Third Parties (CTPs) Regime: What Customers Need to Know

On November 12, 2024, the UK financial services regulators — the Bank of England (BoE), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — published the final documents for the UK Critical Third Parties (CTPs) regime. These documents clarify how the regime will be implemented and expand regulatory oversight to specific services that designated CTPs provide to the UK financial sector.

AWS is preparing to comply with this regime, assuming it will be designated as a CTP.

---

## Key Regulatory Changes

Two core documents define the regime:

- **Supervisory Statement (SS) 6/24**
- **Critical Third Parties Instrument**

The Instrument sets the **mandatory requirements** for designated CTPs, while SS6/24 provides **guidance on interpreting and implementing** those requirements. Together, they form the operational foundation for the new supervisory approach.

---

## What the Regime Introduces

One of the most significant updates is the introduction of **Systemic Third-Party Services (STPS)** — services whose disruption could threaten the stability or confidence of the UK financial system.

Designated CTPs must meet detailed requirements for STPS, including:

- Conducting **scenario testing**  
- Running **incident management playbook exercises**  
- Sharing relevant information with regulators  

The regime becomes effective **1 January 2025**, but will only apply after a provider is formally designated. The designation process will take at least six months, with the first designations expected around **mid-2025**.

Once designated, a CTP has **three months** to submit its first **self-assessment report** on STPS compliance.

The regulatory approach is aligned with **international standards** and ensures interoperability with other jurisdictions.

---

## Overall Objective of the Regime

The regime aims to address **systemic third-party concentration risk** — the risk that a small number of external providers supply critical services to many financial institutions.  

It builds on existing expectations set out in:

- SS1/21  
- SS2/21  
- The *Operational Resilience* policy statement  

These documents shape how financial institutions manage outsourcing, third-party risk, and impact tolerances for important business services.

---

## AWS Commitment

This outcomes-based regime provides CTPs with flexibility in how they demonstrate compliance. It **does not increase the regulatory burden on financial institutions**, but supports a stronger, more resilient UK financial system.

AWS fully supports the regulators’ objectives and values the continued engagement throughout this process. We are committed to:

- Meeting all regulatory requirements  
- Helping customers understand AWS’s approach to the CTP regime  
- Supporting customers in improving their **operational resilience**  

---

## Impact on Customers

Regulators have clarified that the regime **does not remove or reduce the responsibilities** of financial institutions, their boards, or senior management.  

Importantly, it **does not impose new obligations directly on AWS customers**.

However, customers should expect to:

- Provide accurate information about their third-party dependencies  
- Review and update their risk management and due-diligence processes  
- Leverage new information shared by CTPs under the regime  

AWS already provides a wide range of services that support effective **incident management**, across both cloud-native and hybrid environments.  
Guidance on incident management is also available in the **AWS Well-Architected Framework**.

If you have questions about the regime or operational resilience practices — including incident management — contact your AWS account team.
