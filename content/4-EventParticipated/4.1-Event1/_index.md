# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1”

### Event Objectives

- AWS AI/ML Services Overview
- Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

### Key Highlights

#### Understanding the AI/ML Landscape & AWS Ecosystem

Overview of AI/ML/GenAI adoption trends in Vietnam

Importance of standardized ML workflows for modern applications

Introduction to the workshop agenda and learning goals

#### AWS AI/ML Services Overview

The session provided a comprehensive deep dive into core AWS ML services:

- Amazon SageMaker – End-to-end ML platform for building, training, tuning, and deploying - - models

- Data preparation & labeling – Ensuring high-quality datasets for optimal model performance

- Integrated MLOps – CI/CD for AI, model registry, experiment tracking, and monitoring

- Live Demo – SageMaker Studio walkthrough: creating notebooks, training, deployment workflows 

#### Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

A thorough exploration of the GenAI ecosystem on AWS:

**Foundation Models** (Claude, Llama, Titan): comparison, strengths, and how to select the right model

**Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

Core prompting strategies

Few-shot prompting

Chain-of-Thought reasoning

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

Architecture for enterprise knowledge integration

Building effective Knowledge Bases

**Bedrock Agents**

Handling multi-step workflows

Integrating tools and external systems

**Guardrails**

Safety policies, content filtering, and compliance

**Live Demo** 

 Building a fully functional Generative AI chatbot using Bedrock

### Key Takeaways

#### Design Mindset

AI-first approach: Begin with the business problem, then tailor the model and architecture

Responsible AI: Safety, compliance, and ethical AI are critical in production environments

Ubiquitous language for AI: Shared vocabulary across Data, ML, DevOps, and Business teams

#### Technical Architecture

Modern AI/ML pipeline: data ingestion → preprocessing → training → deployment → monitoring

RAG & Bedrock Agents: Strategies for building enterprise-ready chatbots and AI assistants

Integration Patterns: Choosing the right Foundation Model and connecting it with application data

MLOps Principles: Automating ML workflows to reduce errors, improve model reproducibility, and accelerate development  

#### Modernization Strategy

Standardizing ML workflows with SageMaker

Implementing Guardrails for safe and compliant GenAI applications

Cost optimization through model selection and automated training workflows

Real-world use cases: Chatbots, content classification, customer support automation, internal knowledge retrieval

### Applying to Work

Build end-to-end ML pipelines with SageMaker and integrated MLOps

Apply RAG to enhance enterprise search and internal knowledge systems

Create GenAI chatbots for business workflows

Evaluate Foundation Models based on latency, accuracy, and cost

Integrate Amazon Bedrock into existing applications to automate tasks and improve productivity

### Event Experience

Attending AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 provided a holistic view of how AI/ML and GenAI are built, deployed, and scaled on AWS. Key experiences included:

#### Learning from AWS Experts
AWS Vietnamese experts shared in-depth insights into the AI/ML ecosystem and real-world deployment patterns

Practical case studies helped clarify how to select models, design pipelines, and ensure safe AI practices


#### Hands-on technical exposure
The SageMaker Studio Demo illustrated the complete ML lifecycle

Clear understanding of RAG architecture, Bedrock Agents, and Foundation Model selection

Practical exercises in prompt engineering with modern techniques

#### Exploring Modern Tools
Learned how to build a GenAI chatbot quickly using Bedrock

Understood how Guardrails ensure safe and responsible AI behavior

#### Meaningful Networking
The workshop created spaces to exchange ideas with AWS professionals and AI/ML practitioners

Strengthened the ubiquitous language between technical and business teams

#### Lessons learned
GenAI solutions require a complete architecture, not just a model

RAG greatly improves the accuracy of enterprise GenAI applications

MLOps is essential for scaling ML in production

Foundation Models should be chosen based on real business requirements—not trends


> The workshop not only delivered strong technical knowledge but also reshaped my mindset on building AI/ML applications, deploying GenAI responsibly, and leveraging the AWS ecosystem effectively.
